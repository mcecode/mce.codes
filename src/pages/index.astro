    title="Turned"
    description="As I progressed as a psychometrician, I realized that I really needed to up my skills in statistics. Due to this, one of the things that I decided to learn was coding, so that I could delve deeper on data analysis and statistical tests, among others. However, the more I learned how to code, the more I realized how much I really liked it, all the more when I discovered web development. This reached the point where I started to consider actually changing careers."
