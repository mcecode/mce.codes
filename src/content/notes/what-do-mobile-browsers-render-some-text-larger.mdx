title: "What Do: Mobile Browsers Render Some Text Larger"

import Picture from "@/components/picture.astro";

import largeTextOnMobileJpg from "@/assets/large-text-on-mobile.jpg";

Given the following situation on mobile where certain text are rendered larger
than the font size you've set:

<Picture
	alt="One code block being rendered with significantly larger text compared to another code block."
	{...largeTextOnMobileJpg}
/>

What do if you want consistent font size rendering on all platforms?

Disable any text inflation algorithms being applied by browsers:

```css
html {
	-webkit-text-size-adjust: none;
	text-size-adjust: none;
}
```

**Note:** Some ancient WebKit-based browsers, specifically Chrome 27 and Safari
6 or older, had a bug where they prevented zooming in and out if
`-webkit-text-size-adjust` is set to `none`. Realistically, practically nobody
uses these browsers anymore, but if you want to cover all of your bases, setting
`-webkit-text-size-adjust` to `100%` instead of `none` has the same effect.

## Additional Information

Since web browsing was initially a desktop only thing mobile browsers
implemented ways to make websites designed for desktops to work on mobile. This
included enlarging certain text using text inflation algorithms.

In my specific case, this text enlargement was going awry on this website's code
blocks when they reached a certain horizontal length. Interestingly, it only
happened on iOS Safari and not on Android Chrome. This leads me to believe that
this might be a bug in Safari. Particularly, because this website sets the
`content` of `<meta name="viewport">` to
`width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0`, which should tell browsers that they
don't need to do any weird text scaling since this website is already built with
different device sizes in mind. I couldn't pinpoint exactly what conditions are
needed to manifest this, but during my testing, it seems it has to do with the
following structure where a parent set to `display` `inline-block` has a child
set to `position` `relative` that's displaying monospace text of a certain size
and length:

```html
<pre style="display: inline-block">
<code style="position: relative">Some long text here...</code>
</pre>
```

I'm not sure how accurate this is, but for now, that's as far as I got and am
willing to go to investigate it.
